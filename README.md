# TTK4115-LinearSystems

>This repository contains the lab work and reports done in the course Linear system theory. The first part focuses on LQR control of a helicopter and the rest focuses on Kalman filtering a model of a boat in matlab.

>In the helicopter lab we were awarded the score of 91, and in the boat lab we achieved a score of 95 out of 100. Applying the corresponding weights(60/40) to these scores it averages to 92.6 out of 100 and counted 50% of the final grade.
